Data Type RDF (module for Omeka S)
==================================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__

[Data Type RDF] is a module for [Omeka S] that implements some [RDF datatypes]
and an [XSD datatype] recommended by the World Wide Web consortium [W3C] in
order to simplify user input and to give a better semanticity to the values of
the properties.

Added rdf and xsd datatypes:
- [`rdf:HTML`](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-html): an html fragment
- [`rdf:XMLLiteral`](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-XMLLiteral): an xml fragment
- [`xsd:boolean`](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/#boolean): true or false

Number and date time data types can be managed with module [Numeric Data Types].


Installation
------------

First, install the optional module [Generic] if wanted.

The module uses an external js library for the html editor, so use the release
zip to install it, or use and init the source.

* From the zip

Download the last release [DataTypeRdf.zip] from the list of releases (the master
does not contain the dependency), and uncompress it in the `modules` directory.

* From the source and for development:

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `DataTypeRdf`, and go to the root module, and run:

```sh
composer install --no-dev
```

Note: the library "CodeMirror" has no file "codemirror.js" by default: it is
created automatically when installing packages with npm. To use it via composer,
the zip file from codemirror.net (v5) is used.

Then install it like any other Omeka module.

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module] and follow the
config instructions.


Usage
-----

The data types are automatically available through the resource templates. It is
not recommended to use too many data types by property. One to four types are
enough in most of the cases.


TODO
----

- [ ] Simplify search ([Omeka S issue #1241]).
- [ ] Manage inline maximization of html for ckeditor.
- [ ] Add xsd:token or a derivative for standard or custom enumerations (language, etc.).
- [ ] Manage restrictions via the resource templates (default value for boolean,
  default tokens, css for html, xsl for xml…).


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [module issues] page on GitLab.
